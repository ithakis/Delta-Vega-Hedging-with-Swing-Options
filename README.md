# Delta-Vega Hedging with Swing Options

**Quantitative Simulation and Analysis of Delta-Vega Hedging using Variance Swaps under the Heston Model**

---

## Overview

This repository provides a comprehensive, simulation-based study of delta and vega hedging strategies for European options, focusing on the use of variance swaps as vega hedges. The study is performed under the Heston stochastic volatility model, with all analyses and experiments contained in a single Jupyter notebook: **`Delta-Vega Notebook.ipynb`**.

The notebook is designed for **quantitative analysts** and practitioners who wish to:

- Understand and simulate delta and vega risk management in equity options.
- Analyze the impact of variance swaps as vega hedging instruments.
- Explore the effects of transaction costs, model parameters, and market events (such as earnings jumps).
- Visualize hedging performance and risk metrics under a range of market scenarios.

All computational finance routines (simulation, pricing, and analytics) are implemented in **`myUtils.py`**, allowing the notebook to focus on scenario construction, results, and interpretation.

## Structure

### 1. `Delta-Vega Notebook.ipynb`

This notebook is the main entry point, providing:

- **Introduction:** Delta hedging, the Heston model (dynamics, pricing, sensitivities).
- **Variance Swaps:** Payoff, strike and notional calculation, running value.
- **Scenario Analysis:** 
    - Impact of vega hedging (with/without variance swaps).
    - Effects of different maturities, volatilities, vol-of-vol, and hedging frequencies.
    - Cost assumptions and real-world market frictions.
    - Visualization of results: P&L distributions, hedging performance, risk metrics (VaR/CVaR).
- **Earnings Gap Modeling:** Simulates price jumps and analyzes their impact on hedging.
- **Conclusion:** Summarizes quantitative findings and practical considerations.

> **Note:** All heavy-lifting (simulation, pricing, analytics) is delegated to routines in `myUtils.py`. For full reproducibility, ensure both the notebook and `myUtils.py` are present in your working directory.

### 2. `myUtils.py`

This module provides advanced, production-grade quantitative finance tools, including:

- **Stochastic Simulation:** Heston model path generation (Quadratic-Exponential scheme, earnings shocks).
- **Option Pricing:** 
    - Heston model option pricing and Greeks (via QuantLib and analytical methods).
    - Black-Scholes option pricing and Greeks for benchmarking.
- **Variance Swaps:**
    - Analytical and discrete strike calculation under Heston dynamics.
    - Variance swap notional calculation and mark-to-market.
    - Delta-Vega hedge ratio computation.
- **Risk and Performance Analytics:** 
    - P&L simulation and distribution analysis.
    - Bootstrap confidence intervals for P&L, VaR, CVaR.
    - Normality diagnostics for risk distributions.
- **Utilities:** Fast vectorized routines (NumPy, Numba, joblib), advanced plotting (matplotlib, seaborn), and robust statistical tools.

**Designed for extensibility and use outside the notebook as well.**

## Python Environment Setup (Python 3.12 & QuantLib Notice)

This project is tested with **Python 3.12** and makes use of several advanced scientific and quantitative finance libraries. Please follow these steps to ensure a working environment:

1. **Create a Python 3.12 Virtual Environment**
    ```bash
    python3.12 -m venv dvh-env
    source dvh-env/bin/activate  # On Windows: dvh-env\Scripts\activate
    ```

2. **Install Core Dependencies**
    ```bash
    pip install numpy scipy matplotlib seaborn py_vollib_vectorized bootstrapped numba joblib scienceplots tqdm jupyter
    ```

3. **QuantLib Installation â€“ Special Note**

    **This repository uses a custom version of QuantLib with intraday calculation support.**

    - If you have access to the custom QuantLib wheel or source:  
      Install it as follows (replace `<path_to_custom_quantlib>` with your file):
      ```bash
      pip install <path_to_custom_quantlib>
      ```
    - If you do **not** have the custom QuantLib version, install the standard one:
      ```bash
      pip install QuantLib-Python
      ```
      **However:**  
      Many simulations and analytics in this repo may expect intraday support for QuantLib. If you encounter errors or missing features:
      - **Modify `myUtils.py`** and your simulation settings to use only **daily hedging** (i.e., set hedging intervals and maturities to integer numbers of days).
      - All "intraday" features must be ignored or replaced with daily-only logic for full compatibility.

4. **Test Your Installation**
    ```python
    import numpy, scipy, matplotlib, seaborn, QuantLib, py_vollib_vectorized, bootstrapped, numba, joblib, tqdm
    ```

5. **Run the Notebook**
    ```bash
    jupyter notebook "Delta-Vega Notebook.ipynb"
    ```

**Troubleshooting QuantLib:**  
If you see errors related to intraday features or date/time handling in QuantLib, you likely do not have the custom version.  
- **Solution:** Edit `myUtils.py` and the notebook to use only *daily* hedging/frequencies.  
- All core analyses (delta/vega hedging, variance swaps, etc.) can be performed in daily steps with standard QuantLib.

## For Quantitative Analysts

- **Code Transparency:** All models and formulas are fully documented in `myUtils.py`. You can trace, modify, or extend any routine.
- **Reproducibility:** The notebook is designed for reproducibility. Change simulation parameters directly in the notebook to explore your own scenarios.
- **Performance:** Leveraging Numba, joblib, and QuantLib for high-performance simulations.
- **Research-Grade:** Analytical derivations are included as docstrings; empirical results are statistically evaluated (bootstrap CIs, normality tests, etc.).
